# Store Locator

## What it is?

Use of the Google Maps API and a MySQL database to render a map and list of office locations sorted by attribute.

## Changes you'll need to make:

- in "index.php", in line 183, you'll need to replace yourdatabase.yoursqlinstance.com with the URL at which your database is located;
- in "phpsqlsearch_dbinfo.php", you'll need to enter your database username, password, and the database in which the office information has been stored

There is an example located at http://premiumbrandt.com/atamapping which builds on the code here.
